=== CHANGELOG ===

v1.1.0 (2011-12-22)

  * Added two new tracks from KanonBaum (Brian Peppers).
  * Can now choose length of game (30s, 60s, 90s, etc), rather than being limited to the track length.
  * Read track length from .ogg file (yeah, asking the user to enter it manually was dumb!).
  * Prevented user from adding multiple copies of the same track to their tracklist.

v1.0.0 (2011-12-10)

  * All releases now include source code.
  * Added Windows INSTALLER.
  * Stopped spitting out more than one hoop at once, since there is a good chance that the keyboard can't read two keys at once.
  * Added menu on game-over, so you can go replay the same game or go back to menu or quit.
  * Added one-player mode to allow player to control either dancer (previously only 2-player mode was available).
  * Reduced font size so that it is easier to use the GUI.
  * Removed beeps when you play correctly (still get buzz when you fail).
  * Fixed occasional graphical glitches.
  * OSX package now runs on OS X 10.5 or later.
  * Linux version now works with Ruby 1.9.3

v0.1.1 (2011-05-17) - Trivial changes, unless you have OS X :P

  * === Added OS X [10.6] executable.

  * Overwrites the same log file each time it is run (before it created one for every run).
  * Slightly increased size of dancers.

 v0.1.0 (2011-04-27)

  * First public release

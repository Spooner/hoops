h1. === An indeterminate number of hoops! ===

* Website: http://spooner.github.com/games/hoops/
* The game was developed by Spooner (Bil Bas) bil.bagpuss@gmail.com

h2. Description

Hoops is a retro 2.5D game in which both players must dance as indicated by the rolling hula hoops.

h3. User settings

Hoops saves per-user-settings in the '~/.hoops_spooner' folder (This is probably 'C:\Users\<username>\.hoops_spooner\' on Windows).
Until a proper way to edit settings is implemented, if you need to change keys, you should edit
these YAML files manually.

h3. Logs

Hoops creates a log every time it runs (because it is still beta). If you have problems or crashes, it will help to include a copy of the log
in your report :)
